##Important Note  
Guys, please respect the work of each other and please do not steal other people's ideas.    
I already have clone of my Scary Flight game in App Store and it saddens me.

Is it really hard to add to my —Åode the new design?    
Please, use my code as you wish, but please do not use icons, sounds and any kind of image assets.    
Think difference ;)   
Thanks!
